# Pneumonia-Detection
This project aims to use Machine Learning algorithm to classify users based on the presence of Pneumonia using their chest X-rays

To download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia, you will need the "kaggle.json" file (Kaggle API token) to use the given extraction code in this repository

Steps to download the Kaggle API token.
1. Create an account on Kaggle/Sign In
2. Go to “Account”, go down the page, and find the “API” section.
3. Click the “Create New API Token” button.
4. The “kaggle.json” file will be downloaded.

The required libraries for using the code have been specified in the first cell of the code.
