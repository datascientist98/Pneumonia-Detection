# Pneumonia-Detection
This project aims to use Machine Learning algorithm to classify users based on the presence of Pneumonia using their chest X-rays

Pneumonia is a lung infection that ranges from mild to life-threatening consequences. In order to identify the infection, radiologists examine chest X-ray images to identify possible infection. By analyzing the "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" dataset on Kaggle, we aim machine learning algorithms to help identify the presence of Pneumonia in patients and to facilitate diagnosis at a larger scale.

NOTE:

To download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia, you will need the "kaggle.json" file (Kaggle API token) to use the given extraction code in this repository

Steps to download the Kaggle API token.
1. Create an account on Kaggle/Sign In
2. Go to “Account”, go down the page, and find the “API” section.
3. Click the “Create New API Token” button.
4. The “kaggle.json” file will be downloaded.
